# Research Kit

*Conduct systematic research faster with AI assistance.*

**A toolkit that empowers researchers to follow structured research workflows with the help of Systematic Research Development (SRD) and AI research assistants.**

## What is Systematic Research Development?

Systematic Research Development **transforms how research is conducted**. Instead of ad-hoc exploration and informal note-taking, SRD provides a structured framework that guides researchers through each stage of their work—from defining research questions to publishing findings—with AI assistance at every step.

## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](installation.md)
- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)
- [Local Development](local-development.md)

## Core Philosophy

Systematic Research Development is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Question-driven research** where research questions define the "*what*" before methodology defines the "*how*"
- **Rigorous methodology design** using research principles and ethical guidelines
- **Multi-phase research workflow** rather than unstructured exploration
- **AI-assisted systematic inquiry** that maintains research quality and integrity

## Research Phases

| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Definition** | Research Questions | <ul><li>Define research topics and questions</li><li>Establish scope and boundaries</li><li>Clarify objectives and expected outcomes</li><li>Create structured research definitions</li></ul> |
| **Methodology** | Research Design | <ul><li>Design research methodology</li><li>Plan data collection approaches</li><li>Identify sources and resources</li><li>Address ethical considerations</li></ul> |
| **Analysis** | Data & Findings | <ul><li>Conduct literature review</li><li>Collect and analyze data</li><li>Identify patterns and themes</li><li>Validate findings</li></ul> |
| **Synthesis** | Conclusions | <ul><li>Synthesize findings across sources</li><li>Draw evidence-based conclusions</li><li>Connect to existing literature</li><li>Address limitations</li></ul> |
| **Publication** | Dissemination | <ul><li>Prepare research outputs</li><li>Write papers or reports</li><li>Create presentations</li><li>Share findings</li></ul> |

## Research Goals

Our toolkit supports diverse research needs:

### Academic Research

- Conduct literature reviews and meta-analyses
- Design empirical studies (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods)
- Validate research with rigor criteria (credibility, transferability, dependability)
- Support peer review and publication workflows

### Market Research

- Analyze competitive landscapes
- Gather and synthesize market intelligence
- Identify trends and opportunities
- Support data-driven business decisions

### Technical Research

- Investigate technologies and approaches
- Compare solutions and frameworks
- Document findings and recommendations
- Support architectural decision-making

### Exploratory Research

- Scope emerging topics
- Build knowledge bases
- Explore new domains
- Support learning and discovery

## Workflow Features

### Structured Templates

- **Research definitions** that clearly articulate questions and scope
- **Methodology templates** for designing rigorous research approaches
- **Literature review frameworks** for systematic source analysis
- **Analysis templates** for organizing findings
- **Publication scaffolds** for preparing outputs

### AI Research Assistants

Research Kit works with multiple AI assistants:
- Claude Code (Anthropic)
- GitHub Copilot
- Gemini CLI (Google)
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- And 10+ more agents

Each assistant receives the same structured prompts and templates, ensuring consistent research quality regardless of which tool you use.

### Git-Based Organization

- **Research topic branches** (e.g., `001-literature-review`, `002-methodology-design`)
- **Version control** for research artifacts
- **Collaboration support** for team research
- **Branch-based isolation** for parallel research streams

### Quality Assurance

- **Principles-based guardrails** that enforce research standards
- **Ethical review checklists** for responsible research
- **Bias mitigation protocols** to maintain objectivity
- **Validation workflows** to ensure rigor

## Key Differences from Software Development Tools

Research Kit is **NOT** for:
- ❌ Software implementation or code generation
- ❌ Specification-driven development (use [Spec Kit](https://github.com/anthropics/spec-kit) for that)
- ❌ Building applications or systems

Research Kit **IS** for:
- ✅ Systematic inquiry and knowledge discovery
- ✅ Literature reviews and meta-analyses
- ✅ Data collection and analysis
- ✅ Evidence-based conclusions and publications
- ✅ Research methodology design

## Relationship to Spec Kit

Research Kit is a fork of [Spec Kit](https://github.com/anthropics/spec-kit), adapted for research workflows. While Spec Kit focuses on software development and Specification-Driven Development (SDD), Research Kit focuses on systematic research and Systematic Research Development (SRD).

If you need to build software applications, use Spec Kit. If you need to conduct research, use Research Kit.
