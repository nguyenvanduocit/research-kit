# Research Definition: AWS AI-DLC and Spec-Driven Development for Research Processes

**Research Branch**: `001-ai-dlc-spec-research`
**Created**: 2025-11-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "research about the aws AI-DLC and spec-drivent development and how to apply it to the researching"

## Overview

This research investigates how AI development lifecycle methodologies and spec-driven development principles can be systematically integrated into research processes to enhance quality, reproducibility, and efficiency. Drawing inspiration from AWS AI-DLC and other development frameworks, the study focuses on creating a methodology-first approach where AI tools (like Claude, GPT, and specialized research tools) follow structured lifecycles throughout the research process. The research emphasizes systematic AI integration at each phase - from planning through execution to validation and monitoring. Special attention is given to spec-driven practices including test specifications (defining expected outcomes), behavior specifications (handling edge cases), interface contracts (clear phase inputs/outputs), and quality gates (progression criteria). This approach is particularly relevant for qualitative research and literature reviews where systematic methodology can address traditional challenges of reproducibility and validation.

## Research Questions *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Research questions should be PRIORITIZED by importance.
  Each question should be INDEPENDENTLY INVESTIGABLE - meaning you could investigate
  just ONE question and still produce valuable, actionable insights.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each question, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each question as a standalone investigation that can be:
  - Researched independently
  - Answered with its own methodology
  - Delivered as a standalone finding
  - Valuable to stakeholders on its own
-->

### Primary Research Question (Priority: P1)

How can AI development lifecycle methodologies and spec-driven development principles be systematically integrated into qualitative research and literature review processes to enhance quality, reproducibility, and AI tool utilization?

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational question that establishes the methodology-first approach for AI-integrated research, essential for transforming how researchers work with AI tools systematically rather than ad-hoc.

**Independent Investigation**: Can be fully answered by analyzing development lifecycle documentation, spec-driven practices, and creating practical frameworks for research contexts, delivering a comprehensive integration methodology.

**Success Indicators**:

1. **Given** AWS AI-DLC documentation and technical resources, **When** systematic analysis is applied, **Then** produce a complete mapping of AI-DLC components to research phases
2. **Given** spec-driven development methodologies, **When** evaluated against research requirements, **Then** identify transferable practices and adaptation requirements

### Secondary Question 1 - Implementation Patterns (Priority: P2)

What specific implementation patterns, tools, and workflows from AI-DLC can be directly applied to different types of research (academic, technical, market)?

**Why this priority**: Practical implementation guidance is essential for researchers to actually adopt these methodologies. This bridges theory to practice.

**Independent Investigation**: Can be investigated through analysis of AI-DLC implementation examples, research workflow documentation, and creation of practical templates.

**Success Indicators**:

1. **Given** AI-DLC workflow patterns, **When** mapped to research types, **Then** produce specific workflow templates for each research category
2. **Given** existing research tools and AI-DLC toolchain, **When** integration points analyzed, **Then** identify compatible tools and necessary adaptations

### Secondary Question 2 - Quality and Reproducibility (Priority: P3)

How do spec-driven approaches improve research quality, reproducibility, and validation compared to traditional research methods?

**Why this priority**: Understanding the quality improvements justifies the effort of adopting these methodologies and provides measurable benefits.

**Independent Investigation**: Can be evaluated through comparative analysis of traditional vs. spec-driven research approaches using case studies and metrics.

**Success Indicators**:

1. **Given** traditional research methods and spec-driven alternatives, **When** compared on quality metrics, **Then** quantify improvements in reproducibility and validation
2. **Given** spec-driven research examples, **When** analyzed for quality outcomes, **Then** identify best practices and anti-patterns

---

### Secondary Question 3 - Challenges and Limitations (Priority: P4)

What are the key challenges, limitations, and prerequisites for implementing AI-DLC and spec-driven approaches in research contexts?

**Why this priority**: Understanding barriers to adoption helps researchers prepare for implementation challenges and set realistic expectations.

**Independent Investigation**: Can be investigated through analysis of failed implementations, expert interviews (if available), and technical requirement assessments.

**Success Indicators**:

1. **Given** implementation case studies, **When** analyzed for failure points, **Then** identify common challenges and mitigation strategies
2. **Given** technical and organizational requirements, **When** assessed against typical research environments, **Then** determine feasibility criteria

### Edge Cases & Boundary Conditions

- What if AWS-specific tools are not available in the research environment?
- How to handle qualitative research that doesn't fit traditional spec-driven models?
- What scope boundaries prevent overengineering simple research projects?
