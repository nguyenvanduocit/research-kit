## Research Workflow Commands

Use these commands to conduct systematic research:

1. **`/research.principles`** - Establish research principles and ethical guidelines
2. **`/research.define`** - Define research question, objectives, and scope
3. **`/research.clarify`** - Interactive Q&A to refine research parameters
4. **`/research.methodology`** - Design research approach, methods, and validation criteria
5. **`/research.tasks`** - Break down methodology into ordered research activities
6. **`/research.execute`** - Conduct research and compile comprehensive report

## Research Quality Standards

### Source Quality
- Prioritize peer-reviewed academic sources for academic research
- Verify credibility of sources (author expertise, publication reputation, date)
- Cross-reference findings across multiple independent sources
- Document source limitations and potential biases

### Citation Requirements
- All claims must be supported by citations in BibTeX format
- Include both in-text citations and full bibliography in sources.bib
- Use consistent citation style throughout research
- Cite primary sources when possible, not secondary summaries

### Research Rigor
- Define clear research questions before beginning investigation
- Document research methodology and limitations
- Distinguish between findings, interpretations, and opinions
- Acknowledge gaps in evidence and areas requiring further investigation
- Consider alternative explanations and counterarguments

### Ethical Considerations
- Respect intellectual property and proper attribution
- Avoid plagiarism through proper paraphrasing and citation
- Consider privacy implications when researching individuals/organizations
- Disclose conflicts of interest or potential biases
- Follow discipline-specific ethical guidelines

## Citation Format

Use BibTeX format for all citations:

```bibtex
@article{author2024title,
  author = {Last, First and Last, First},
  title = {Article Title},
  journal = {Journal Name},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {123-145},
  doi = {10.1000/example}
}
```
