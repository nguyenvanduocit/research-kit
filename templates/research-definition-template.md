**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Overview

[Provide a brief, clear description of what this research aims to investigate. Include the context, motivation, and why this research is important or valuable.]

## Research Type

Select the primary type(s) that best describe this research:

- [ ] Academic Research (scholarly, peer-reviewed focus)
- [ ] Market/Business Research (commercial, competitive, customer insights)
- [ ] Technical Research (technology evaluation, feasibility studies)
- [ ] General Investigation (exploratory, broad information gathering)

## Research Questions *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Research questions should be PRIORITIZED by importance.
  Each question should be INDEPENDENTLY INVESTIGABLE - meaning you could investigate
  just ONE question and still produce valuable, actionable insights.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each question, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each question as a standalone investigation that can be:
  - Researched independently
  - Answered with its own methodology
  - Delivered as a standalone finding
  - Valuable to stakeholders on its own
-->
